# Omar's Games App

Author: Omar Diaz Martinez

Date/Version: 2024 v1.1

## Narrative
I wanted to list my favorite games to share my passion for video games. To make a space where I can document all of my games, such as my favorite games, gaming journey, track of current, or look forward to games. This app will reflect upon my love for video games and provide a mental health escape from everyday stress. 

## Issue
I tend to not keep track of my favorite games or games I want to play in the future, due to playing many of them! I often forget games in the past or on a wishlist. Sometimes I want to get back to the games I favored the most but tend to forget the mechanics. 

## Test
I want to be able to play a game, by opening my app choosing my favorite games, and understanding the mechanics behind it. I want to update the status of the games I played so that if I enjoy games more than one of my favorite games I can change it. I want to have a list of all the games I currently play or have played. Also, I want to be able to share or collaborate with others on what games they played and recommendations. I want to have a list of upcoming games on my radar and remind me when it releases by linking my PlayStation account to this app.
